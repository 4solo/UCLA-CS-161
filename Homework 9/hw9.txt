1.	a.) See complete Bayesian network in test.net

	b.) To achieve P(D|T) >= 0.3, we can constrain the following:
		P(D=yes) >= 0.008942
		P(T=positive|D=no) <= 0.002219

		This is all according to SamIAm's sensitivity analysis. In other words,
		probability of disease must be at least 0.008942,
		probability of a false positive must be at most 0.002219,
		probability of a false negative cannot be constrained to achieve P(D|T) >= 0.3

2.	The set of variables and their values are shown below.
	*Notice OtherDogBarking is not used for EM, MAP, or MPE.
	It is there for structure, as it is a necessary variable according to the story.

		FamilyHome: Yes, No
		ExpectingGuests: Yes, No
		DogBowelTrouble: Yes, No
		DogOutside: Yes, No
		DogBarking: Yes, No
		*(OtherDogBarking: Yes, No)
		HearableBarking: Yes, No
		SoundSensor: On, Off
		SoundSensorHealth: OK, Broken
		OutdoorLight: On, Off
		LightSensor: On, Off
		LightSensorHealth: OK, Broken
		Battery: OK, Dead

	The causal structure seen in the sambot.net file is copied below:
		FamilyHome -> DogOutside
		DogBowelTrouble -> DogOutside
		DogOutside -> DogBarking
		DogBarking -> HearableBarking
		OtherDogBarking ->HearableBarking
		HearableBarking -> SoundSensor
		SoundSensorHealth -> SoundSensor
		Battery -> SoundSensor
		
		FamilyHome -> OutdoorLight
		ExpectingGuests -> OutdoorLight
		OutdoorLight -> LightSensorwa
		LightSensorHealth -> LightSensor
		Battery -> LightSensor

	We run the EM algorithm (ignoring OtherDogBarking) in order to find CPTs. 

	a.) If we open the monitors and set OutdoorLight=On, HearabeBarking=No,
		then run MPE after EM, we obtain the following variables.

		Battery: OK
		DogBarking: No
		DogBowelTrouble: Yes
		DogOutside: Yes
		ExpectingGuests: No
		FamilyHome: No
		LightSensor: On
		LightSensorHealth: OK
		SoundSensor: Off
		SoundSensorHealth: OK

		P(mpe,e)=0.1526
		P(mpe|e)=0.3705

	b.) Similarly, we set FamilyHome=Yes, ExpectingGuests=No,
		then run MAP on the EM file to obtain these sensor variables.

		Battery: OK
		LightSensorHealth: OK
		SoundSensorHealth: OK

		LightSensor: Off
		SoundSensor: Off

		P(mpe,e)=0.0301
		P(mpe|e)=0.1567


	c.) Given Z={Battery, FamilyHome}, we know that the two sensors are independent.
		Battery diverges into the sensors.
		Likewise, FamilyHome diverges into the sensors (though indirectly).
		So, given values of Z, the sensors are d-separated and conditionally independent.

	d.) We have constructed a multiply-connected network here.
